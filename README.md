# Explore the relationships between variables and identify patterns and trends
Perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of your choice, such as the Titanic dataset . Explore the relationships between variables and identify patterns and trends in the data.

## Data Cleaning
Load the Data: Load the dataset and check its structure.

Missing Values: Identify and handle missing values.

Data Types: Ensure all data types are appropriate for analysis.

Duplicates: Check and remove any duplicate records.

Outliers: Identify and handle any outliers if necessary.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Univariate Analysis: Analyze individual variables to understand their distributions.

Bivariate Analysis: Explore relationships between pairs of variables.

Multivariate Analysis: Examine relationships involving more than two variables.

Visualization: Use visualizations to uncover patterns and trends.

## ML- model Random Forest Classifier
Random forests or random decision forests is an ensemble learning method for classification, regression and other tasks that operates by constructing a multitude of decision trees at training time.
